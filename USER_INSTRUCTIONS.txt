===============================================================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

PROBLEM: Windows Defender blocks the application
SOLUTION: 
  1. Click "More info" when the warning appears
  2. Click "Run anyway"
  
  This is a FALSE POSITIVE. PyInstaller executables are often flagged
  by antivirus software. The application is safe for educational use.

---

PROBLEM: "Port 5000 is already in use" error
SOLUTION:
  1. Close any other applications using port 5000
  2. Common culprits: Other Flask apps, AirPlay on Mac
  3. Restart your computer if the issue persists

---

PROBLEM: Browser doesn't open automatically
SOLUTION:
  1. Manually open your browser
  2. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
  3. Or try: http://localhost:5000

---

PROBLEM: "Permission denied" or "Access denied" errors
SOLUTION:
  1. Run the application from a folder where you have write permissions
  2. Don't run from C:\Program Files or other protected folders
  3. Try running from your Desktop or Documents folder

---

PROBLEM: Application crashes immediately
SOLUTION:
  1. Make sure you have at least 200 MB free disk space
  2. Check if antivirus is blocking the application
  3. Try running as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)

---

PROBLEM: Labs don't work correctly
SOLUTION:
  1. Close the application completely
  2. Delete the database.db file (if it exists in the same folder)
  3. Restart the application (it will create a fresh database)

===============================================================================
  USING WITH BURP SUITE
===============================================================================

1. Configure Burp Suite proxy (usually 127.0.0.1:8080)

2. Configure your browser to use Burp proxy

3. In Burp, go to Proxy → Options → Proxy Listeners

4. Make sure intercept is ON when you want to capture requests

5. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser

6. All requests will now be captured in Burp Suite!

===============================================================================
  TIPS FOR STUDENTS
===============================================================================

✓ Start with Lab 1 (easiest) and progress sequentially
✓ Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests
✓ Read the lab descriptions carefully for hints
✓ Each lab has a FLAG to capture upon successful exploitation
✓ Take notes on your methodology for future reference
✓ Practice ethical hacking principles
✓ Don't use these techniques on real websites without permission!
